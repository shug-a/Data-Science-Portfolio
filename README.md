**1.Linear Regression project for ecommerce company**

Given a data of some ecommerce company website and mobile app users I need to figure out whether company should focus on mobile app or website development more.

**Conclusion**: "Length of Membership" is the most correlated feature with "Yearly Amount Spent". And average time on app is around 150 times higher then average website time.

So if we are going to run ad-campaign it would be more effective on mobile app, but our dev power should be focused on website as there is significant lack of user attention.
